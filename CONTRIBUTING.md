# Contributing

So, you want to help this project. Good news, you: I need help here!

There are lots of ways you help, and here are some examples and
guidelines. (Note: you're also welcome to contribute to this file, proposing
changes or other examples. So meta!)

## Finding bugs

So, you found a bug in the code and either you know how to fix it or want
someone to work on it.

The first thing you should do is try to come up with a (MWE)[] that demonstrates
the issue. After all, you could be working on a large codebase as far as I know,
and checking thousands of lines of code would be impractical for me.

[MWE]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Working_Example

After that, tell me exactly what went wrong and what should be happening.
Please, show me every bit of math or code you think is relevant (and keep in
mind: I'm not an expert in anything, you may have to teach me a thing or two).
While you're at it, please recheck your math and make sure that my code is
the one doing the wrong thing.

Finally, submit an issue here on GitHub, containing all the needed details I
need to reproduce the problem, and, if relevant, come up with a unit test, so
this issue won't come again in the future.

After submitting the issue, if you want to solve it yourself, please, feel free
to submit a pull request. More on this in the [Solving Issues](#Solving issues)
section bellow.
